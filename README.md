2. [Personal Project](PythonCR/Personal%20project)
  - 2.1. [UFC model](PythonCR/Personal%20project/UfcModel.ipynb) -> This notebook is everything I have tried throughout the semester regarding my personal project. In it I have all the different models I tried to model the data, different data preparation techniques, as well as data gathering scrapper.

  - 2.2. [Dataset notebook](PythonCR/Personal%20Project/Dataset.ipynb) -> This dataset notebook was created because I decided that I will combine two datasets into one. I wanted to have a place where I do this instead of doing it in one notebook.

  - 2.3. [Logistic regression model notebook](PythonCR/Personal%20Project/LogisticRegressionUFC.ipynb) -> Here I have narrowed down my work into the logistic regression model. It was proposed to me and I focused mainly on this model.
