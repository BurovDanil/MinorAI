- **General description**

My paper prototype involves an ankle strap designed to gather valuable health data such as blood oxygen levels, heart rate, body temperature, activity levels, and coughing. This data is essential because it can help detect stress, respiratory issues, illnesses, and injuries in calves. Early detection of these conditions could significantly improve animal health and potentially save lives.

- **Technology**

With the help of embedded systems I think it is possible to wire all these sensors with an ESP32 or Arduino board and collect data and create an AI diagnostics model that is initially trained with the already collected data.

- **Possible issues**

While my initial idea is to place the strap around the ankle, as I believe it will be less intrusive for the calf, it is possible that the device could be placed around the neck as well. However, the neck placement might cause discomfort to the calf, which is why I think this aspect should be further discussed to determine the most optimal location for the device.

Another possible issue might be the fact that even if the strap is not expensive if you want to supply all the calves with the device it might be expensive. One solution to this problem could be when the calf drinks water. To my knowledge when a calf drinks water the number on the ear is scanned and that way the vet knows if it is drinking water. We can monitor this activity and if the animal is showing inactivity and does not drink water then the strap could be used to further track the animals' health.
