## Purpose or Goal (Current Situation, Problem, Desired Situation, Benefits)
- Why should you design/develop it? (always start with the why)

- Current situation
Currently our stakeholder DAP Thewi is facing problems regarding organizing data and monitoring health of all the farms' calves that they are looking after. Thewi B.V collects data such as, how they treat the calves, the iron levels in their blood, information about the calf, such as, hair colour, nationality, etc., data before the calf is being slaughtered, such as, weight, age. All this data is not ordered and is not used for any predictive purpose. 

- Problem
The main problem that the group will fix is to make use of the scattered data and organize it in a way to be trained in a AI model and later on used to predict a calfs' the illness and mortality.

- Desired Situation 
The aim of the project is to develop a AI prediction model that is user-friendly for Thewi to be used and be able to accurately predict illness and mortality in calves.

- Benefits 
If implemented is successful it will ensure that the death rate of Thewis' farms drops and calves are taken care of on time. 

Our group has three possible project ideas that could fit in these two separate problems that the company is facing.
