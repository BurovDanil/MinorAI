\section{Proposal}


The goal of my personal challenge will be to create a prediction model regarding MMA fights.
The idea of the model will be to be able to estimate how a match up between two professional atheletes
will end up. In order to ensure accuracy of the model I will scrape statistical data from the official website of the UFC,
and from there I will store the data and train the model later. 

One of the issues I have noticed will be the legal aspect of my project. The project could be regarded as a betting system, where a person
uses the model to bet on the fighter that the AI has said it is going to win. In order to prevent that I have the idea to make the model
less accurate on purpose.

Another potential issue I see with this project is the legal aspect of it. It envolves getting personal data of the fighters, such as: Name, Height, Weight, Age, 
Record, and statistical data on how the fighter finishes his fights and different record related data. To prevent any legal issues I will make sure that everybody has access
to it and then I will store the data and teach the model.
